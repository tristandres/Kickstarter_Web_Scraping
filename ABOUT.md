# Kickstarter_Web_Scraping
My web-scraping project on Kickstarter explored the ideal characteristics a project needs to have the highest probability of being successful.

Dict_for_categories.csv is used in the Project Kickstarter.IPYNB to be able to convert categories scrapped into a category and subcategory tuple.

Analysis.IPYNB is used for exploring the data scrapped and for data visualization.

Kickstarter3 is used as the data set for Analysis.IPYNB as my IP was banned after scrapping 20 rows of data.

The Kickstarter folder contains my python code for scraping Kickstarter's website.

Project Kickstarter.IPYNB is used to clean and organize the data pulled via the scrapy spider in the Kickstarter folder.
